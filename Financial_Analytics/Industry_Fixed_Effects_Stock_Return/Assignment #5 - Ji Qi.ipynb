The range of average stock returns is from **-0.25 to 0.52** among 24 different industries.\n","\n","- **The lowest average stock returns** is around **-0.25** and its corresponding industry is **Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment**. Despite the continuous chip shortage starting from the outbreak of COVID 19, The 2022 stock price for the semiconductor industry appears to go down. Several leading stocks like Nvidia, Taiwan Semiconductor and Intel are **all down over 20% year to date** due to **downgrades** and the **increased risk of consumer spending decreasing**. For instance, On April 11th, Baird downgraded Nvidia to neutral and reduced its price target from **```$360``` to ```$225```**, because there exists a slowdown in consumer spending, especially in China's consumer market, the smartphone market shifts and headwinds caused by the Russian embargo. Furthermore, South Korea, a hub for semiconductor production, **relies on Neon, xenon and krypton** used in the production of advanced chips and **imported from Russia and Ukraine**. However, **the recent tension between Russia and Ukraine and accompanying sanctions on Russia have cut off its supply**. \n","\n","- **The highest average stock returns is around -0.52** and its corresponding industry is **Energy**. In general, the Energy sector includes energy equipment and services, and oil, gas and consumable fuels. With the gradual reopening of the global economy, the demand in oil has incredibly increased. In the other hand, **the total oil inventories have declined due to some cautious producers like OPEC and U.S. Especially, rising tensions amid Russia/Ukraine war exacerbated the oil shortage, which in turn highly increase the oil prices**. In addition, **Valuations in the Energy sector are attractive relative to the other sectors**. Although there are the strong gains in energy stock prices, they have not kept up with rapidly rising earnings expectations. "],"metadata":{"id":"ZRjosTALyrrG"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#

Those values are generated by including all 24 industry indicators in the regression model. If dropping one or more indicators, both R-squared and adj R-squared decrease. In terms of the explanatory power of these regressions, 32.6% of variation in Year to date Stock Return has been explained by the variation in 24 industry indicators.
