This proved to be right because when we ran model with these variables, their MAE was higher than the one without. We also dropped start time and stop time due to possible information leakage, because the model would have a predictor that provides it with some information about when the trip completed, in time. We also dropped bike ID because the blue bike model is uniform throughout, so it is necessary to keep the bike ID's\n",

Monthly subscribed users have 45 minutes and then they are charged money. We considered the possibility of people accidentally forgetting to lock the bike, which would increase the trip duration without actually traveling further distance. We explored the data and found out that only 1% of the data satisfies this condition. When we dropped what we defined as outliers, the model improved by a lot. We also learnt that there is a possibility of overfitting into the data depending on the definition of outlier. For instance, if we exclude people who travel longer than 30 minutes, then the train MAE will be much lower because the trip duration range itself is decreased. However, the model will perform poorly on validation set. This was an example of overfitting the data. Our train mae was almost equivalent to test mae.\n",

Finally, the mae for the hold-out test set with Google-Map API is quite similar to the mae for the hold-out test set without Google-Map API."

We used test and split method to keep 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing. Because the split function shuffles the observations by default, we did not have to worry about the imbalance in data distribution. In order to confirm that the validation mae is reliable, we also used cross-validation method and used 5-fold on the training dataset, then validating the model on the test dataset. Both methods represented almost the same mae, which means that our model is compatible with new sample and not overfitting.\n",

In addition, this function automatically picked out the best parameters for the models after setting the searching range for each. In other words, the best parameters for the perfect models is generated by comparing with many combination of parameters of models that human beings is hard to manipulate one by one. "
